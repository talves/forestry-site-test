This is a boilerplate for fast tracking an integration prototype or any light static website. 

It uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to manage content! It runs its tasks with Hugo's own [Hugo Pipes](href="https://gohugo.io/hugo-pipes/").

- Bento is a lunch box made with care.
- The goal is to build up your js and styling src tools so you can keep using them in the final environement after BE integration (shall it be something else than Hugo).
- It uses [Sass](href="https://sass-lang.com") for style.
- It uses [Hugo Pipes](href="https://gohugo.io/hugo-pipes/") for building the assets.
